# Dstat plots

To clarify our D-statistic analysis, we have included the most relevant plots here. We compute D-statistics with ADMIXTOOLS(1) to analyze fine-scale population dynamics between ancient and modern samples. For more information about the data used, refer to the main manuscript.


## F3-statistics
Genetic affinity in terms of shared genetic drift was quantified with the outgroup f3-statistic, with the Mbuti as the outgroup, i.e. f3(Mbuti; Pop1, Pop2), using qp3Pop (1). On the supplementary table (f3 tab), you can fine all possibel combination of this statistics with Dataset 3.3. Here we display 
the combinations that include one of our newly sequenced Southern Chile populations (Figure 1).
