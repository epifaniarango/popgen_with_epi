# Dstat plots

To clarify our D-statistic analysis, we have included the most relevant plots here. We compute D-statistics with ADMIXTOOLS(1) to analyze fine-scale population dynamics between ancient and modern samples. For more information about the data used, refer to the main manuscript.


## F3-statistics
Genetic affinity in terms of shared genetic drift was quantified with the outgroup f3-statistic, with the Mbuti as the outgroup, i.e. f3(Mbuti; Pop1, Pop2), using qp3Pop (1). On the supplementary table (f3 tab), you can fine all possibel combination of this statistics with Dataset 3.3. Here we display 
the combinations that include one of our newly sequenced Southern Chile populations (Figure 1).

***Figure 1:*** Outgroup f3-statistics of the form f3(Mbuti, X, Y) being X: A) Lafkenche B) Pehuenche C) Huilliche-Chiloe and Y all the available populations or ancient samples from Dataset 3.3. Populations on the Y axes are ordered based on an decreasing value of the f3 results. 

## F4-statistics
In our first overview, we explored allele sharing between Mapuche groups with the configuration f4(Mbuti, X; Y, Z), where X is any ancient and modern population of the dataset and Y and Z are combinations of Lafkenche, Pehuenche, and Huilliche-Chiloé. As expected, our new samples have a high degree of allele sharing with each other. The only sample close to being significant in this configuration is the one which includes two individuals from CC_Conchali_700BP (Figure 2).

***Figure 2:*** :  f4-statistics to check the genetic continuity between modern Mapuche groups against significant allele sharing with other ancient and modern populations. A) f4(Mbuti, X; Lafkenche, Pehuenche) B) f4(Mbuti, X; Pehuenche, Huilliche-Chiloe). C) f4(Mbuti, X; Lafkenche, Huilliche-Chiloe). The statistics were calculated using all the available SNPs (blue) and only transversions (red). On the X axes, we observe the Zscore, and the vertical lines represent |Z|= 3.3 and 3.
