## Introduction

The southernmost regions of South America have long been of interest to researchers studying the earliest evidence of human presence in the Americas. Despite this, comprehensive insights into the connections between these regions and the broader continent and the context of present-day indigenous ancestries have remained elusive. In our recent study published in Current Biology, we delved into the genetic ancestry of one of the most significant indigenous groups in South America, the Mapuche. Through the analysis of genome-wide data from 64 individuals representing three distinct Mapuche populations in Southern Chile - the Pehuenche, Lafkenche, and Huilliche from Chilo√© - we aimed to shed light on the complex genetic history of this region.

Our research reveals the presence of three predominant ancestry blocks with a shared origin, defining the genetic landscape of the Southern Cone, the Central Andes, and Amazonia. Notably, we unearth evidence of the Mapuche lineage's divergence from the Far South during the Middle Holocene, indicating limited subsequent migratory movements from the north. Furthermore, our investigation uncovers compelling genetic interchange between the Central and Southern Andes, likely corresponding to the spread of cultural elements from the Central Andes, including agricultural practices and linguistic influences from Quechua into Mapudungun, the native language of the Mapuche.

Moreover, we document a significant genetic affinity between the three examined populations, with the Huilliche displaying distinctive genetic signatures resulting from recent intensive exchanges with the Far South. Our study not only contributes novel perspectives to the genetic history of South America, from its initial settlement to the contemporary indigenous presence, but also underscores the importance of incorporating indigenous knowledge and perspectives through community engagement, as our subsequent fieldwork endeavors have demonstrated.
