# Dstat plots

To clarify our D-statistic analysis, we have included the most relevant plots here. We compute D-statistics with ADMIXTOOLS(1) to analyze fine-scale population dynamics between ancient and modern samples. For more information about the data used, refer to the main manuscript.


## F3-statistics
Genetic affinity in terms of shared genetic drift was quantified with the outgroup f3-statistic, with the Mbuti as the outgroup, i.e. f3(Mbuti; Pop1, Pop2), using qp3Pop (1). On the supplementary table (f3 tab), you can fine all possibel combination of this statistics with Dataset 3.3. Here we display 
the combinations that include one of our newly sequenced Southern Chile populations (Figure 1).

## F4-statistics
In our first overview, we explored allele sharing between Mapuche groups with the configuration f4(Mbuti, X; Y, Z), where X is any ancient and modern population of the dataset and Y and Z are combinations of Lafkenche, Pehuenche, and Huilliche-Chiloé. As expected, our new samples have a high degree of allele sharing with each other. The only sample close to being significant in this configuration is the one which includes two individuals from CC_Conchali_700BP (Figure 2).

***Figure 2:***  f4-statistics to check the genetic continuity between modern Mapuche groups against significant allele sharing with other ancient and modern populations. A) f4(Mbuti, X; Lafkenche, Pehuenche) B) f4(Mbuti, X; Pehuenche, Huilliche-Chiloe). C) f4(Mbuti, X; Lafkenche, Huilliche-Chiloe). The statistics were calculated using all the available SNPs (blue) and only transversions (red). On the X axes, we observe the Zscore, and the vertical lines represent |Z|= 3.3 and 3. 

We further explored the relationship between Mapuche and Conchalí with an f4 in the following format: f4(Mbuti, Lafkenche/Pehuenche/Huilliche-Chiloe; Conchalí, Ancient sample / Modern sample) and  f4(Mbuti, Ancient sample / Modern samples; Conchalí, Lafkenche/Pehuenche/HuillicheChiloe;) (Figure 3). The affinity of modern Mapuche populations to Conchalí is higher than any other contemporary group and almost with all the available ancient samples (Figure 3.A-B). We also found some striking relationships between Conchalí_700BP and with Brazil_LapaDoSanto_9,600BP (Figure 3.B) and with a few Far South individuals (Aonikenk_400BP and Selknam_400BP).

***Figure 3:*** f4-statistics to check the preferential affinity of modern Mapuche groups with Conchalí_700BP. The statistics were calculated using all the available SNPs (blue) and only transversions (red). Ancient samples in positions A) Z, and B) X, and modern populations in positions C)Z and D) X. We observe the Zscore and the vertical lines represent |Z|= 3.3 and 3, and on the Y axes, samples are ordered based on an increasing Zscore.

The available ancient samples geographically closer to our Mapuche and Hulliche samples are CC_Conchalí_700BP, CC_LosRieles_5100BP, and CC_LosRieles_12000BP. We designed several f4-statistics of the form: f4(Mbuti, Pehuenche/Lafkenche/Huilliche-Chiloe; CC ancient, FS ancient) (Figure 4). The close relationship of CC_Conchali_700BP to the contemporary Mapuche samples is consistent through all the tests performed. An affinity with CC_LosRieles_5100BP is also shown, but non-significant, and only when certain Southern Cone samples are in the configuration. Confirming the scenario of a population replacement after the Early Holocene (2) in Central Chile, CC_LosRieles_12000BP shows no affinity towards later SC populations but with other geographically more distant Early Holocene samples from the Southern Cone (Figure 4.C).

***Figure 4:*** f4-statistics to check affinity of ancient Central Chile samples with modern Southern Chile (SC).  The statistics were calculated using all the available SNPs (blue) and only transversions (red). A) Z= Conchali_700BP. B) Z= LosRieles_5100BP. C) Z= LosRieles_1200BP. On the X axes, we observe the Zscore and the vertical lines represent |Z|= 3.3 and 3, and on the Y axes, samples are ordered based on an increasing Zscore.

Nakatsuka et al. (3) reported gene flow between a Late Holocene ancestry related to CC_Conchali_700BP and Late Holocene Far South samples like Aonikenk, Haus, Yamana, and Selknam, using the statistic f4(Mbuti, CC_Conchali_700BP; Middle Holocene FS, Late Holocene FS). We verified that this migration also involved the ancestors of contemporary Mapuche ancestry with a similar configuration (Figure 5).

***Figure 5:***  f4-statistics confirm gene flow between contemporary Mapuche and Late Holocene Central Chile (Conchalí) populations with Late Holocene Far South. The statistics were calculated using all the available SNPs (blue) and only transversions (red). A) FS_LaArcillosa2_5800BP, B) FS_PuntaSantaAna_7300BP and C) FS_Ayayema_4700BP. On the X axes, we observe the Zscore and the vertical lines represent |Z|= 3.3 and 3, and on the Y axes, samples are ordered based on a decreasing Zscore. Only statistics with more than 30,000 SNPs are represented. 

We also try the same approach to assess if this migration occurred in other areas (Argentinian Pampas and/or Central Andes). In both cases, we do not find significant results that would suggest gene flow (Figure 6 and 7). The relative abundance of ancient samples in the Andes gives more strength to the lack of signal.

The statistics were calculated using all the available SNPs (blue) and only transversions (red). A) Argentina_ArroyoSeco2_7700BP and B)Argentina_LagunaChica_6800BP. On the X axes, we observe the Zscore and the vertical lines represent |Z|= 3.3 and 3, and on the Y axes, samples are ordered based on a decreasing Zscore. Only statistics with more than 30,000 SNPs are represented.

***Figure 7:*** f4-statistics deniying a strong signal of gene flow between contemporary Mapuche and Late Holocene Central Chile (Conchalí) populations with the Andes. The statistics were calculated using all the available SNPs (blue) and only transversions (red). A) Peru_Cuncaicha_9000BP, B)Peru_Lauricocha_8600BP, C)Peru_Cuncaicha_4200BP, D)Peru_LaGalgada_4100BP, and E)Peru_Lauricocha_3500BP. On the X axes, we observe the Zscore and the vertical lines represent |Z|= 3.3 and 3, and on the Y axes, samples are ordered based on a decreasing Zscore. Only statistics with more than 30,000 SNPs are represented.


By testing the configuration f4(Mbuti, X; Central/Southern Chile, Argentina/Far South), where X is any ancient or modern sample not from the Southern Cone, we find consistent symmetry in relationships to populations outside the Southern Cone, except for the Middle Holocene ArroyoSeco2_7700BP and LagunaChica_6800BP (Supplementary Table).
